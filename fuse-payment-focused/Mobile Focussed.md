Most non-crypto-native users are increasingly making their payments using their mobile phones using mobile checkout wallets like Google Pay or Apple Pay and mobile neobank apps like Cash App, Venmo, and Revolut. Even many banks have now developed their own mobile apps to compete with digital-native platforms.

Moreover, in many developing countries, more people own mobile phones than have bank accounts and access to other traditional financial services. Many people in regions like Africa even rely on their cell phone balances for making daily payments and obtaining loans.

Hence, we are convinced that if Web3 payments are to provide an attractive alternative to the legacy system or enable people in some places to leapfrog it all together, they need to be as convenient to make on mobile as people are accustomed to.

The critical pillar in Fuse's mobile-first strategy is Fuse Wallet, an open-source, cross-platform modular mobile front-end for web3 payments and related use cases built on the Flutter software.
