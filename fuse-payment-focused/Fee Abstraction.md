Currently, in most cases, Web3 users must submit blockchain transactions they wish to execute themselves. Among other things, this means that they also have to deal with blockchain transaction fees.

This almost certainly presents a major hurdle for adopting Web3 payments as non-Web3-native users are accustomed to not paying any fees per transaction when paying in legacy environments, be it bank transfers, credit card payments, neobank apps, Stripe, PayPal, and so on.

In our view, most users will not be comfortable with paying fees for individual transactions in the future, which means that a third party (an operator) will have to cover the fees for them.

To accomplish this, operators rely on the services of transaction relayers. The Charge platform on Fuse currently provides relayer services (see the Fuse Stack section for more details).

In the future, relayer services will be part of the function we expect incentivized Power Validators to perform. Please refer to the Fuse V2 section for more details.
