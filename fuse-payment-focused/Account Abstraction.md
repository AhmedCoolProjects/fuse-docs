Account abstraction is one of the core ideas behind Fuse's approach to pursuing mass adoption of Web3 payments.

Account abstraction means that while a user still initiates/signs a transaction using the private key of their respective public address, they send an instruction to a smart contract controlling their smart account.

The smart account contract (which on EVM chains like Fuse Network is a fully functional account) then submits the user-submitted transaction to the blockchain. Importantly, the user retains full control over their smart contract account, meaning only they can initiate transactions.

This approach has important benefits that will, in our view, be crucial to web3 payment popularization.

First, it enables automation such as payment streaming, conditional payments, etc. Users can authorize their smart contracts to perform certain operations.

Most importantly, account abstraction allows the implementation of another core principle of the Fuse Web3 payment playbook - fee abstraction (discussed in the following subsection).
