As laid out in more detail in the [Fuse Today](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LdmeTBjede0-BcSd0W0/s/goUiB6chXvy8iVhpHHNd/understanding-fuse/fuse-today) section, the Fuse platform currently has two key components: the Fuse Network blockchain and the payment-focused infrastructure.

These components fueled the emergence of a vibrant [ecosystem](https://fuse.io/ecosystem) that includes more traditional crypto projects and projects focusing on real-world payments and related services.

However, taking Fuse to a new level where it becomes primed for mass adoption by businesses and consumers requires adding other important components.

These will include strong incentives for the providers of important infrastructure services and operators onboarding users to Fuse, switching to a new consensus mechanism, and adding a privacy layer.

Please refer to the [Fuse V2](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LdmeTBjede0-BcSd0W0/s/goUiB6chXvy8iVhpHHNd/understanding-fuse/fuse-v2-next-chapter) section for a more detailed overview of the upcoming transition.
