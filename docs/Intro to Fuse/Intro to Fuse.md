Fuse is an open platform powered by a public layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain Fuse Network.

However, unlike most other public blockchain platforms, Fuse is not attempting to be a world computer and cater to all the possible applications of smart contracts.

Instead, Fuse focuses on the vertical where we believe the Web3 technologies have the most significant chance of having a major impact on the real world - namely, payments.

Fuse's vision is thus not about competing with Ethereum and other major blockchain platforms but about transforming the global payment system and becoming a major alternative payment rail for businesses and people worldwide.

At least three significant problems plague the existing global payment system. First, it largely relates to technologies predating even Internet adoption. Aspects of their operations, such as error correction, can be time-consuming and highly costly (e.g., customer exceptions in SWIFT).

Secondly, the current setup relies heavily on a range of financial intermediaries. This is especially obvious in the case of credit card transactions, where the possibility of transaction reverting makes it necessary to have several entities involved, each of which takes a cut.

In addition to raising the cost of payments beyond what it should be, these flaws preclude potentially essential use cases such as micro-transactions and automation like payment streaming, batched payments, conditional payments, etc.

Finally, the current payment system is heavily fragmented and siloed. Major payment environments are not interoperable and do not have universal geographic coverage. This creates particular friction for cross-border payments.

Bringing Web3 technologies like the blockchain into the mix makes it possible to solve these issues. Changing the state of the blockchain ledger requires just sending a transaction, which, if valid, will be automatically reflected by all the blockchain nodes. There is no need for specialized entities to run, modify, and reconcile multiple poorly interoperable databases.

Also, blockchain transactions cannot be reverted without the consent of the payment recipient, and they do not require reconciling bank balances. Consequently, there is no need for multiple intermediaries such as issuing and acquiring banks, underwriters, etc.

Blockchains are also borderless and universal by design, enabling anyone to transact with anyone peer-to-peer, regardless of where they are and what digital environment they operate in. The parties only need the control of private keys of their respective public addresses.

Therefore, we are convinced that Web3 payments can successfully compete with legacy approaches, and we have been building and developing the Fuse platform to maximize their potential.
