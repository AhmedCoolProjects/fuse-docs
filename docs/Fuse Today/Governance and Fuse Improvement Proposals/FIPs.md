FIPS are Fuse Improvement proposals published on GitHub that extend and improve the network's capabilities over time. Proposals can be suggested by any entity and discussed under this GitHub repository:

[FIPs/FIPS at master - fuseio/FIPs](https://github.com/fuseio/FIPs/tree/master/FIPS)

After proposing and discussing every proposal, the proposal that will be implemented is voted on by the validators before upgrading the network.
