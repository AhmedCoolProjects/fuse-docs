description: Interoperability with other major blockchains is essential for the growth of Fuse and realizing its vision.
---

One way to ensure the growth of Fuse and its prospects is by enabling additional versions (wrappers) of FUSE on other chains.

Unlike FUSE on Fuse Network, those wrappers are ERC20 tokens created whenever someone locks a certain number of tokens on the Fuse and gets issued the same amount of wrapper tokens on the target blockchain. If a user withdraws the wrapper from the target blockchain, the tokens are burned, and the FUSE tokens on Fuse are unlocked.

Currently, wrapped versions of the FUSE token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain, and the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge, and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.
