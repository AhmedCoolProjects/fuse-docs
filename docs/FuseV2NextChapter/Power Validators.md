## Trusted Middleware

Blockchain applications and wallets depend on various middleware services that are external to the on-chain logic. In the Fuse Stack, those services include relayers, account management, Wallet API’s, verification and more. While currently we give a solution with the Hosted service, providing great UX to the user:

_Middleware problem_

The vision of Fuse still and always was to build a decentralised payments infrastructure. Moreover, the reliability and security of a Dapp is equal to its weakest dependency. The goal of Power Validators is to form a reliable and sufficiently decentralised layer that provides those services. While the security and incentivization for those services is provided by the Fuse Network.

## Becoming a Power Validator

To become a Power Validator, the validators will need to “restake” its Fuse tokens. Meaning that the staked Fuse tokens, will be used for another purpose in addition to securing the Fuse Network. In case the Power validators misbehave or malfunctions the staked Fuse can be slashed.

## Power Validators will be able to run this year

- Transaction relaying
- Account creation and management
- Automation and recurring payments
