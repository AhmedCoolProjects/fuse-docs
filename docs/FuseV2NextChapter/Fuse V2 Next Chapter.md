As we mentioned in Fuse Today vs Fuse V2, until today, the development of Fuse as a payment-focused blockchain platform has largely relied on the infrastructure (middleware stack) created by Fuse Labs. This was sufficient to carry us quite far but priming Fuse for mass business and consumer adoption requires that the infrastructure on top of the Fuse Network blockchain become more robust and decentralized.

## Operators and Power Validators

We believe that the road to Fuse becoming a major global payment rail lies in creating strong incentives for two kinds of service providers that web3 platforms currently mostly overlook: Operators and Power Validators. Operators are needed to bring everyday users over to web3 payments, while power validators will provide the reliable infrastructure that will enable operators to do so.

Supercharging the middleware through incentivization will be crucial but not sufficient without changes to the underlying transaction execution engine. Currently, all the transactions on Fuse happen on a single layer - the Fuse Network blockchain. So far, this has not posed problems, as everyone who wanted to transact on Fuse has been able to do so without throughput issues.

However, extending web3 payments to the enormous space of real-world commerce and usage raises the issues of privacy and scalability which a single traditional layer-1 blockchain is not capable of addressing without abandoning its decentralized and permissionless nature.

## Privacy and Scale

Many businesses and users need privacy to embrace web3 payments for their everyday needs. They want to be able to send and receive private transactions and conceal their balances from the public.

However, for too long, privacy had not been the focus of public blockchains and the technology wasn't mature yet. This is starting to change, as we see in the coming of age of the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.

ZKP's make it possible to off-chain transactions in a fast and secure way, while also keeping them private but auditable.

Moving most of the transactions off-chain (away from layer 1) will help solve the scalability issue as well. In the Fuse vision, most of the transactions will happen off-chain. The layer-1 Fuse Network blockchain will be used to secure the second layers, help verify private transactions and execute major value transfers.

## Consensus Upgrade

At present, the Fuse Network blockchain relies on the AuRa consensus model. It had originally been developed for proof-of-authority blockchains but the Fuse team managed to successfully modify it to run one of the first forms of delegated proof of stake (DPoS). It has enabled on-chain governance and delegated staking.

However, this approach is becoming increasingly incompatible with the state of the art in the blockchain space, spearheaded by the Ethereum PoS effort. Hence, we are planning to upgrade the Fuse consensus mechanism and bring it line with the industry best practices.
